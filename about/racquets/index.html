          <h3>Racquets</h3>
          <p>
            Inspired by a recent comment from a reader I thought I’d look into the various models of racquet Roger Federer has used since he went pro way back in 1998.
            Of course this is all open to interpretation, as there’s various opinions on whether or not Roger uses the racquet that is sold via the various tennis retailers.
            Some people believe that Roger just uses his own custom version based on the Pro Staff 85 that’s just sprayed up to look like the latest model.
            Personally I’m not sure, it’s hard to judge when I’ve not have the pleasure of owning one of his played with racquets (feel free to send me one Roger)
            but I’d imagine there are some subtle differences compared to the retail version – the weight, handle thickness, balance, swingweight, lead tape etc will
            all be specific to his game. But I do believe Roger will take advantage of the latest technologies in his racket composition to both help with control, feel
            and power.
            In terms of hard fact we know that he’s used a Wilson all his career, played the majority of it with a 90 square inch racquet head and used a 16 x 19 string
            pattern with Natural gut on his main strings, Luxilon Big Banger Alu Power Rough on his crosses with some string savers which add durability. Prior to that he
            used an 85 square inch racquet that used Babolat all natural gut strings on both crosses and mains.
            So let’s take a look at the different models that Roger has used and Wilson have marketed as his weapon of choice since the start of his career:
