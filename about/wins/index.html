          <h3>Wins</h3>
          <p>
            Federer has won an all-time record 17 Grand Slam singles titles and has reached a record 27 Grand Slam finals (10 consecutive, and another 8 consecutive – the two longest streaks
            in history. Actually, the only thing preventing them from being 20 consecutive finals was the 2010 French Open quarter-finals where Roger lost to Robin Soderling, who he had beaten
            one year prior in the 2009 French Open final), 23 consecutive semi-final appearances, and 36 consecutive quarter-final appearances. He is one of eight men to have won a career Grand
            Slam (winning all four Grand Slams at least once) and one of four players to have won a career Grand Slam on three different surfaces, hard, grass & clay courts. Federer has won 7
            wimbledon titles, a joint all-time record with William Renshaw and Pete Sampras. He is the only player to reach 10 Wimbledon finals, which is an all-time record in men’s tennis. He is
            one of three players to win two different Grand Slams at least 5 times (Wimbledon and US Open) and is the only player to win two Grand Slams five consecutive times at Wimbledon from
            2003–07 and the US Open from 2004–08. Roger Federer has spent 302 weeks as the No. 1 ranked player in the world (ranked No. 1 for 237 consecutive weeks), the most of any men's tennis
            player in the Open Era and all-time.
